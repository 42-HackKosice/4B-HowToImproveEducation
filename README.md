Because we are High School students we can only refer on the education mainly on our school but we think that is not as much different as College education.  
After discusing possible ways of education we came with nothing new, but we created the form in Slovak language because our school use the Slovak language.
Most interesting findings are more talked about in the Video Presentation.

Our decisions came from the basics of the basic steps of Data analysis:

# Challenges and accomplishments

Biggest problem for us was that we don't write down our ideas when we talk about them and when is the time we need them, we don't have them.  
But as we said, wrote earlier the main thing you need is the data.

# Next Steps
* [ ] Collect Data
* [ ] Visualize them
